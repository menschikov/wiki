# June 2018 - Data structure

- We were designing the shape of [hotel descriptive data](https://github.com/windingtree/wiki/issues/22)
- We were designing the shape of [inventory data](https://github.com/windingtree/wiki/issues/23)
- We were designing the shape of [pricing data](https://github.com/windingtree/wiki/issues/25)
- We were designing the shape of [availability data](https://github.com/windingtree/wiki/issues/27)
  - And published all of that on [GitHub Pages](http://windingtree.github.io/docs/swagger-ui/) and [our blog](https://blog.windingtree.com/on-data-shapes-and-formats-978e9906f9a6)
- We have a new buddy in development team, [Hynek](https://github.com/hynek-urban)
- We have an experimental [swarm](https://github.com/windingtree/off-chain-adapter-swarm) data adapter
- We have an experimental [https](https://github.com/windingtree/off-chain-adapter-http) data adapter
- We have published a specification of [summer release](https://github.com/orgs/windingtree/projects/1)
- We have created a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/windingtree) to talk technical stuff
- We have hosted a workshop in [TTC](https://www.traveltechcon.com/) 
- We are further developing the [ERC827](https://github.com/windingtree/erc827) standard we need for our [Lif token](https://github.com/windingtree/lif-token)

# May 2018 - Distributed storages

- We've finally implemented a [Proxy](https://github.com/windingtree/lif-token/pull/331) for lif-token
- We've improved our [documentation for newcomers](https://github.com/windingtree/wiki/pull/11)
- We've done some [research on distributed databases](https://github.com/windingtree/wiki/pull/12)
- The research then led to a re-consideration of the whole data structure and storage options
  - That's why we now enable multiple data schemas and the data is (for now) primarily served off-chain
- We've implemented a [first PoC for off-chain data storage](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-js-libs/pull/127) with [descriptive data for hotels](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-js-libs/pull/125)
- We've participated in [ETH Buenos Aires](https://ethbuenosaires.com/) with the [Pluracle](http://pluracle.com) project ([repo](https://github.com/levelkdev/pluracle))

# April 2018 - Hotel API

- We've designed a [new architecture](https://github.com/windingtree/wiki/pull/10)
- ...and started working on it
  - Simplified hotel contract in [wt-contracts](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-contracts/pull/179)
    - You can track our progress in [proposal/next](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-contracts/commits/proposal/next) branch 
  - We've completely rebuilt the wt-js-libs - [#121](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-js-libs/pull/121), [#122](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-js-libs/pull/122)
    - We're now using [flow](https://flow.org/) and [coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/windingtree/wt-js-libs)
    - We can easily add/remove various data storages
    - You can track our progress in [proposal/next](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-js-libs/commits/proposal/next) branch
  - We are building new REST API over the new wt-js-libs - [#109](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-nodejs-api/pull/109), [#110](https://github.com/windingtree/wt-nodejs-api/pull/110)
    - For now, we only have in-memory JSON storage available, but we're exploring distributed databases
    - We are also working with wallets stored directly in the API for simplicity sake. **We know it's a bad idea and will not use this in production.**
